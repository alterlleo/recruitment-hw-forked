CLAIM:
The allegro sensor output (Vout) is a voltage proportioned with the load current. So Vout = Il * s, where Il = load current and s = sensibility (26.4 mV/A).
I have to check the maximum power: the first idea were suppused to compare in the comparator lm393 the Vout with a voltage divider, where the voltage divider
gave in output the maximum voltage Vref that the load would absorbe if the power spent was 500W. In this way the check was only about the voltage: 
Vout can be major of the Vref, if the load current is low. So I have to check both of current and voltage.
With the multiplier ad633 it is possible to have an voltage output proportioned with the multiplication of two voltage inputs.
So one input is Vout, the other input is Vload: the first input is proportioned with the load current, the second input is the voltage current, so the output will be proportioned with the power.
So after that it is possible to check the ad633 voltage output in the comparator lm393, where Vref is proportioned to the maximum power (check the schematic).
	--> voltage divider: ad633 output value is (x1-x2)(y1-y2)/10V, but (x1-x2) is the output of the allegro sensor. It is also the load current multiplied by sensibility S. So the ad633 output is a value proportioned to the load power, in particular is the value of load power multiplied by S/10V=0.00264. So the Vref of LM393 must be the the power limit (500w) multiplied by the same costant. 500*0.00264=1.3. Now it is time to think the values of the resistances.


Now I have the output, it is better to add a LPF in order to erase bad oscillations.
in order to keep open the relay, the output of the comparator must trigger two transistor: one used to loop the comparator high and the other one to bypass the relay, so it will be open untill someone shut down the system.
